I beleve that the dergree of success of this assignment is 100%. I needed to a sprintf line which creates a message in the pipe. In the switch statement I needed to add a fail case (case -1) if fork() failed to call, a defaut case where it parent must write message to pipe. In case 0 just needed to assign the variables for the child.
