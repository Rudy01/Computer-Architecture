My degree of success with this program is 100%. I approached my project by making a for loop printing each bit for the mantissa and the exponent parts. In the mantissa for loop, I start from 12 and end at 40 because the mantissa starts from the 12 bit (including spaces). Likewise, for the exponent for loop, I start from 2 and at 12 because the exponent starts from the 2 bit (including spaces).

Note: 0 1000 0110 110 1101 1100 0000 0000 0000

      bit 0	bit 1 ...

For printing the sign bit and base 10 I used the sign and floating_vlaue_in_32_bits variables, respectively. I didn't have any major problems with this project. If any problems I would say that the input couldn't skip commas. For example, if you input 5,252 it would read as 5 but you input 5252 it would read as is.
